# Homebridge WLED Preset Plugin

This is a plugin to easily switch between the different presets you have on your WLED. Development is happening on [development branch](https://github.com/goodshort/homebridge-wled-preset/tree/development).

This plugin is based on the [template Homebridge platform plugin](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge-plugin-template/) and the [accessory example](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge-examples/tree/master/accessory-example-typescript).
